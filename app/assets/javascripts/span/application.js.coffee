# app/assets/javascripts/span/application.js.coffee
#
# This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js.coffee,
# which will include all the files listed below.
#
# Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
# or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
#
# It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do,
# it'll appear at the bottom of the compiled file.
#
# Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
# about supported directives.
